        <h3>Trees produces oxygen that is life line of all living beings.
           In the hot summer we usually plan trips in the hilly areas. But if the rate of cutting Trees remains same then we don’t have enough Trees to plan a trip, seasonal raining and amount of fresh oxygen will no longer be available. Trees helps to clean the air, soil and water,  making the earth a beautiful livable place. Living close to trees makes us healthier and happier. Its time to SAVE Trees, protect forests and spread awareness. If you want to save trees, you can help by protecting those that grow around your home, and planting more Trees.

        <h2>Saving Trees Around You</h2>
        <h3>Every town and city has laws dictating which tree species need to be protected and when and how it’s OK to cut down trees. In some areas, trees that are delicate, rare or extremely beneficial are protected by law. Knowing the laws in your area will help you be a better advocate for the trees there.</h3>

        <h2>What you can do to save the Tree</h2>
        <h3>Speak up to save the tree, rather than just letting it get cut down. Get together with other people who care about saving trees in your area and make it clear that you object to cutting down healthy trees. Even if there’s no law against cutting down the tree, if enough people think trees are important and need to be protected, you might be able to create change. Even if it’s too late for this particular tree, you’ll set a precedent for next time. Here are a few things you can do: • Write a letter of objection to your city forester or city council member. • Start a petition to change policies or protect certain trees. Rally neighbors to get involved in saving the neighborhood trees. • Get the media involved by sending a letter to the editor or contacting a local TV station.</h3>

        <h2>Participate in Tree plantation</h2>
        <h3>As important as it is to protect mature trees, it’s also essential to think ahead and plant new trees that will eventually get tall enough to contribute to the canopy, clean the air and help keep temperatures cool. Many towns and cities have organizations like Portland, Oregon’s Friends of Trees[5] working to plant trees in areas that have too few. If your town or city doesn’t have a similar organization, why not start one yourself? Tree by tree, you can make a difference. • The type of tree you plant matters. Talk with an arborist about which species are native to your area and will eventually get big enough to clean the air and water. Small, ornamental trees won’t contribute much. • Buying trees can get expensive. See if there’s a nursery nearby that shares your views on trees and could give your group a discount on baby trees.</h3>

        <h2>Save: remaining Forests</h2>
        <h3>Forests in Brazil, Russia, Canada and other parts of the world are being cut down or burned by forest fires every day. 78 million acres of rainforest are lost every single year. Scientists posit that if forest destruction continues at this rate, 80 to 90 percent of rain forests will by gone by 2020. Since forests play an essential part in keeping our planet healthy, stopping their destruction can’t happen soon enough. • Most forests are destroyed to provide space for agriculture or developments, to provide wood for paper products, or by forest fires that have increased in severity since the advent of global warming. • Saving forests must be a global effort, but there are things you can do to contribute, even if you live nowhere near a rain forest. Share your love for trees and forests with other people. Showing those in your life that you care about trees is a good way to help other people start taking action, too. Many people simply don’t realize how important old growth forests are to the health of the planet, including its human population. The more people who understand and care, the more likely destructive practices will be brought to a halt. • Spread the word on social media. When you see a story related to the state of the earth’s forest, share what you think about it and encourage others to comment. • Show that standing up for trees is something you believe in. Since saving trees will require a change in lifestyle, some people oppose the idea. By making it clear that saving trees is something you believe is valuable, you’ll be acting as a role model to others.</h3>

      <h2>Conslusion</h2>
      <h3>Forests and the products they provide are universally required for the continuation of human society as we know it. To change our society to one that does not depend on the forest (to the forest's detriment) and its associated benefits requires such an enormous paradigm shift that we generally do not even consider it worthy of further investigation. Given this situation therefore, it is imperative that we discover mechanisms to manage the forest for all the benefits it can provide, in a sustainable manner.</h3>
